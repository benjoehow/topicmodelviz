<h2>What you see</h2>
<p>This is the first view on loading the visualization. It shows the k topics requested at run time,
in order of prevalence in the corpus. 
<h2> How it is determined</h2>
<p>
Topics are identified by the top three words taken from the --output-topic-keys MALLET output file (topics.tsv). 
<p>
Lengths are determined by the sum of weights for each topic according to the --output-doc-topics MALLET output file (docComp.tsv). Lengths are then scaled to the most prevalent.
